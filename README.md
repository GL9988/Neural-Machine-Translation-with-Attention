# Neural Machine Translation with Attention (PyTorch)

This project builds a custom English-to-French machine translation system using a GRU-based encoder-decoder architecture with attention. The solution was implemented end-to-end in PyTorch, with interactive support from ChatGPT and DeepSeek to debug, design, and refine the entire pipeline.
